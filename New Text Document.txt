Welcome to the Collaborative Problem Space

The collaborative problem space is currently under construction, please stay tuned!

Less Talk, More Do

Rather than spending my time reading books, articles, and looking at "motivational porn", I decided to actually start something I feel passionate about.

The Idea

To give a space for developing ideas and solutions with a problem-focused approach.

Practical Purpose for Us

1) Learn Node.js back-end programming

2) Learn Angular.js front-end programming

3) Resume padder; interviewers are going to be impressed when they hear that you participated in a project which approaches idea generation in a novel way.
